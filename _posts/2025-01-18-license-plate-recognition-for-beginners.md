License Plate Detection (LPR) involves the use of computer vision and machine learning techniques to automatically identify and read vehicle license plates from images or video feeds. This technology transforms visual data into actionable information, enabling automated access control, traffic management, parking solutions, and enhanced security measures.

LPR systems typically consist of two main components:

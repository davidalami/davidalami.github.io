title: "TypeScript Rising: Replacing Python in Multi‑Agent AI Systems"
---


Agentic AI – systems of autonomous agents collaborating to achieve goals – has been a hotbed of innovation. Traditionally, **Python** has dominated this space, powering frameworks like LangChain, AutoGPT, and others that make heavy use of large language models (LLMs). However, a new trend is emerging: **TypeScript**, running on Node.js and the modern web stack, is increasingly being chosen for building multi-agent AI applications. Why are developers moving agent orchestration to TypeScript, and what does that mean for performance, developer experience, and deployment? In this article, we’ll explore the technical reasons behind this shift, comparing TypeScript and Python for agentic AI across several dimensions:

-   **Performance and Concurrency:** How TypeScript’s async/await and Node’s event loop stack up against Python’s `asyncio` and the GIL.
    
-   **Developer Experience and Type Safety:** The benefits of TypeScript’s static typing and rich tooling vs Python’s dynamic approach.
    
-   **Frameworks and SDKs:** A look at TypeScript-first AI agent frameworks (LangChain.js, Portkey, Mastra, VoltAgent) versus Python counterparts (LangChain Python, AutoGen, CrewAI).
    
-   **Runtime Environments and Edge Deployments:** Running AI agents in cloud-native and edge contexts (serverless functions, Cloudflare Workers) – where TypeScript shines.
    
-   **Web Stack Integration:** How TypeScript integrates with modern web development and cloud architectures, and how that compares to Python’s ecosystem.
    
-   **Use Cases – When to Use Which:** Where Python still holds an advantage (e.g. model training and core ML workflows) and where TypeScript excels (orchestration, web-scale agents).
    

By examining concrete examples of projects and community insights, we’ll see why many startups and developers are adopting TypeScript for multi-agent systems – and how Python and TypeScript can even complement each other in this rapidly evolving field.

## Performance and Concurrency in a Multi-Agent World

When building multi-agent AI systems, **concurrency and I/O performance** are critical. Agents often need to perform many tasks in parallel – querying APIs, fetching web data, running tool calls – all without slowing down the overall system. Here, the runtime characteristics of Python vs. Node.js/TypeScript make a big difference.

**Python’s Concurrency Limitations:** Python can certainly handle asynchronous operations using `asyncio`, but it has some well-known constraints. One major factor is the **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** in CPython, which prevents true multi-threaded execution of Python bytecode. While you can run async tasks or use multiprocessing to work around the GIL, it adds complexity and overhead. As [one engineer](https://johnchildseddy.medium.com/typescript-llms-lessons-learned-from-9-months-in-production-4910485e3272#:~:text=Python%E2%80%99s%20strength%20lies%20in%20its,querying%20multiple%20APIs%20more%20challenging) noted from experience on their blog, Python’s lack of native strong concurrency support became a bottleneck as his project scaled: _“Python’s lack of strong concurrency support became a serious issue. Libraries like `asyncio` and FastAPI offer concurrency but come with significant complexity – I had to manually manage event loops and concurrency controls”_
In other words, to keep a multi-agent pipeline responsive, a Python developer might juggle threads, processes or event loop intricacies, which complicates the code.

**TypeScript’s Async/Await Model:** In contrast, TypeScript uses an **event-driven, non-blocking architecture** by default. The async/await pattern in modern JavaScript/TypeScript is straightforward and built into the language, enabling concurrent operations with ease. Node’s single-threaded event loop (combined with a worker pool for heavy I/O) doesn’t have a GIL equivalent, allowing it to handle many concurrent I/O-bound tasks efficiently. Developers often find this model more intuitive for scaling agents. As the same engineer found, _“With Node.js and TypeScript, using `async/await` felt much more intuitive and robust, particularly when managing large-scale web scraping or multiple API calls concurrently”_. Node can keep hundreds of agent tasks in flight without spawning dozens of threads, which **reduces overhead**.

**Real-World Impact:** The difference in concurrency models has practical consequences for multi-agent AI: it affects throughput and infrastructure cost. By switching from Python to TypeScript, the aforementioned developer was able to scale to _“hundreds of concurrent tasks”_ with fewer issues. He leveraged Node libraries (like the **Bottleneck** library for rate-limiting) to gain fine-grained control over concurrency, allowing the system to _“scale without overwhelming resources”_[johnchildseddy.medium.com](https://johnchildseddy.medium.com/typescript-llms-lessons-learned-from-9-months-in-production-4910485e3272#:~:text=As%20I%20scaled%20my%20system,could%20scale%20without%20overwhelming%20resources). The result was more work done in parallel and a **reduction in infrastructure costs**, since the application could process tasks faster and spend less time waiting on external calls.

**Example – Async in TypeScript vs Python:** Both languages support asynchronous HTTP requests, but the developer experience differs. In Python, you might use `asyncio` and an HTTP library like `aiohttp`:


    import asyncio, aiohttp
    
    async def fetch(url):
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            resp = await session.get(url)
            return await resp.text()
    
    async def main():
        urls = ["http://api1", "http://api2", "http://api3"]
        # Kick off multiple fetches concurrently
        results = await asyncio.gather(*(fetch(u) for u in urls))
        print(results)
    
    asyncio.run(main())


In TypeScript, the code would look like:

    import fetch from 'node-fetch';
    
    async function fetchText(url: string): Promise<string> {
      const res = await fetch(url);
      return await res.text();
    }
    
    const urls = ["http://api1", "http://api2", "http://api3"];
    // Kick off multiple fetches concurrently with Promise.all
    const results = await Promise.all(urls.map(fetchText));
    console.log(results);


Both achieve the same goal, but the TypeScript version uses the language’s built-in async/await without needing an external event loop manager. Moreover, Node’s architecture handles these requests in a single process without thread management complexity. For I/O-heavy agent tasks (web requests, database queries, tool invocations), this can lead to lower latency and higher throughput compared to a Python implementation that might hit GIL-related CPU ceilings or require multiple worker processes for similar throughput.

It’s important to note that **Python isn’t “slow” at AI** – far from it. For compute-intensive tasks like model inference, Python can leverage optimized C/C++ libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch) that release the GIL. But for orchestrating many simultaneous _calls_ and interactions (the glue code around those models), Node.js often achieves near C-like performance for I/O. The team at [portkey.ai](https://portkey.ai/blog/why-we-chose-ts-over-python-to-build-potkeys-ai-gateway/#:~:text=Python) (an AI infrastructure startup) faced this challenge when building a distributed AI gateway. They realized that for ultra-low-latency request routing and API calls, Python would be a limiting factor. As they put it, Python is _“relatively slower”_ and **“not supported on edge computing platforms”** (like Cloudflare Workers), so it wasn’t viable for their needs. They narrowed their choices to Rust or TypeScript, ultimately choosing TypeScript for its blend of performance and developer speed.

**Node.js vs Python Throughput:** Another community data point comes from a developer who benchmarked **LangChain** (a popular agent framework) in both TypeScript and Python. By mid-2024, they found _“LangChain JS is up to date with Python, and honestly might be moving faster in JS than Py”_[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/14jweso/langchain_js_vs_python/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2). While this was more about feature parity, it reflects a broader sentiment: well-written TypeScript can match or exceed Python’s performance for orchestrating LLM calls, especially when taking advantage of Node’s concurrency model. In fact, LangChain’s JavaScript/TypeScript version introduced a `Runnable` interface with built-in batch parallelism for LLM calls, something that plays to Node’s strengths[js.langchain.com](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/runnables/#:~:text=Runnable%20interface%20,can%20significantly%20improve%20performance).

Bottom line: **TypeScript’s concurrency model and V8 engine give it an edge in orchestrating multi-agent systems at scale.** It simplifies handling lots of simultaneous tasks, which is core to agentic AI. Python can do similar things, but often with more tuning (e.g., ensuring `asyncio` event loops are properly managed, or resorting to multi-process execution to bypass the GIL). For AI startups needing to manage _web-scale agents_ – handling thousands of user queries or tool actions in parallel – TypeScript offers a performance profile that’s hard to ignore.

## Developer Experience and Type Safety

Beyond raw performance, one of the biggest draws of TypeScript is the **developer experience**. Building complex multi-agent systems is challenging – agents maintain state, pass data to tools, and coordinate with each other. In Python, the lack of compile-time type checking means many bugs surface only at runtime. In TypeScript, the compiler and IDE can catch those issues early, making large agent codebases more maintainable.

**Catching Errors Early:** In a production AI agent project, **type safety** can dramatically reduce runtime errors. When migrating from Python to TypeScript you may note that static typing becomes invaluable as your workflows grow more intricate.  With TypeScript, its level of type safety may significantly reduce error as issues will be caught during development rather than in production. In a multi-agent system, where agents pass messages and data structures around, having the TypeScript compiler enforce that an agent’s output matches the next tool’s expected input (for example) can prevent a whole class of bugs that would cause an LLM to misinterpret data or a tool to throw an exception.

**Tooling and Autocomplete:** Modern developer tools amplify TypeScript’s benefits. Code editors like VS Code provide intelligent autocomplete and refactoring tools powered by TypeScript’s type definitions. This is especially helpful with complex AI frameworks. Working with a large AI library in TypeScript means the IDE can guide you – listing available methods, ensuring you import the right submodule, and warning of incorrect usage. In Python, developers often rely on reading docs or runtime errors for similar feedback. To illustrate, consider defining a tool that an agent can use. In Python (LangChain or similar), you might define a function and not specify the exact schema of inputs/outputs except in docstrings or code comments. If you pass the wrong structure, you’d find out only when running the agent. In TypeScript (with a framework like [Mastra](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra) or [LangChain.js](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs)), you can define the schema with types or even [Zod schemas](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod). For instance, in Mastra an example tool definition uses Zod to declare input/output types, and those types are known at compile time. The benefit is twofold: the framework can validate data at runtime, but as a developer you also get compile-time assurance that your agent and tool agree on the data format. If you change a tool’s output structure, TypeScript will flag any agent code that isn’t updated accordingly – preventing a potential failure before you ever deploy.

**Maintaining Large Codebases:** As agent systems grow, they can turn into sprawling codebases with many moving parts (agents, memory stores, tool plugins, etc.). Static typing scales better in such scenarios. A developer can use standard navigation (e.g., “Go to definition”) to jump through agent logic. In a Python project, especially one that heavily uses dynamic capabilities, it might be harder for new contributors to understand data flows without reading extensive documentation or test outputs. 

In summary, **TypeScript offers a more structured and maintainable developer experience for building agentic AI**, especially as projects move from prototype to production. By catching errors early and providing powerful IDE support, it reduces the “footguns” inherent in complex AI code. Python’s developer experience shines in other ways – its simplicity and huge trove of examples means you can prototype quickly – but when it comes to long-term maintenance of an AI system that might involve dozens of agent behaviors and tool integrations, many teams are finding the rigor of TypeScript to be a worthwhile trade-off.

## Frameworks and SDKs: TypeScript Ecosystem vs Python Ecosystem

**Python’s Head Start:** Python’s dominance in AI meant it had a head start in agent frameworks. As of mid 2025, a list of top open-source agent frameworks was still largely Python-focused: LangChain (Python first, JS second), LangGraph (Python first, JS second), AutoGen by Microsoft (Python), OpenAI’s `agents` (Python, JS second), SuperAGI (Python), CrewAI (Python) Python’s rich ML libraries and the popularity of Jupyter notebooks made it the default choice for experimenting with LLM “agents” initially. For example, **LangChain** started in Python and quickly became the go-to library for chaining LLM calls and tools. Its JavaScript/TypeScript port came later and was initially “limited” in features, causing many to assume Python was the safer bet.

**LangChain.js vs LangChain Py:** In 2023, LangChain’s Python version outpaced the JS version, but by mid-2024 the gap closed. Users reported that LangChain **JS/TS had caught up** with the Python library on most features and was perhaps even _“moving faster in JS than Python”_ as new integrations landed. One reason is that the JavaScript ecosystem for LLMs started maturing: features like async tool calls and streaming were well supported in LangChain.js, and certain integrations (like some vector databases or Supabase) were available in JS earlier or on par with Python. The key takeaway: **LangChain’s capabilities are no longer Python-exclusive**, so developers can choose based on the rest of their stack. In fact, for developers already comfortable with Node, using LangChain **in TypeScript can be preferable**. TypeScript port of LangChain benefitted from a clean-slate design after much of LangChain’s API had stabilized – plus the ergonomic advantages of TypeScript’s tooling.
**LangGraph.js vs LangGraph Py:** LangGraph stands out with its graph-based workflows that enable complex agent handoffs, streaming, and human-in-the-loop patterns. While Python was first to the party, LangGraph JS/TS is rapidly catching up in capability and production readiness. LangGraph Python remains the more mature option. The official JS/TS runtime is comparatively new. So, the Python version continues to serve as the default in many R&D contexts—its mature ecosystem and swarm library (like `langgraph-swarm`) offer robust multi-agent support.

**TypeScript-First Frameworks:** Beyond ports of Python libraries, we’re seeing **TypeScript-first frameworks** purpose-built for agentic AI:

-   **Mastra (TypeScript):** Launched in 2024, Mastra positions itself as a full-stack TypeScript framework specifically for agent applications. It provides abstractions for agents, tools, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows all in one package. The framework touts that you can define your agents and tools in “plain TypeScript” and it handles the rest – including streaming responses, retry logic, evaluation harnesses, and even exposing agents as REST endpoints with type-checked request/response schemas. This removes a lot of the “glue code” that a Python developer might have to write by combining Flask + LangChain + other libraries. Mastra also integrates a state management library (XState) under the hood for durable agent workflows, and it includes a CLI that can scaffold projects and even run a local documentation server for the AI (using the Model Context Protocol) to reduce hallucinations during development. Essentially, it’s aiming to be a **batteries-included, TS-native answer to LangChain**. The draw is clear: for developers who prefer one coherent stack, Mastra avoids having to stitch together Python backends with a JavaScript front-end.
    
-   **Portkey (TypeScript):** Portkey isn’t exactly a framework like LangChain, but rather an **AI gateway and toolkit for production**. It provides features like request routing, observability, caching, and guardrails for LLM applications – and it’s implemented in TypeScript to run on edge networks. The Portkey team explicitly chose TypeScript over Python for building their platform, citing reasons like _“TypeScript compiles to highly optimized JavaScript, perfectly suited for Cloudflare Workers’ V8 engine”_, **“excellent async support”*, and _“static typing catching errors at compile time”_ ([portkey.ai](https://portkey.ai/blog/why-we-chose-ts-over-python-to-build-potkeys-ai-gateway/#:~:text=1,codebase%20grew%2C%20TypeScript%27s%20static%20typing)). Portkey integrates with LangChain.js (as a way to add production capabilities to LangChain-based apps) and effectively fills the gaps needed to deploy agents at scale (things like load balancing LLM calls, adding middleware, etc.). One can think of it as analogous to what FastAPI or Flask might require add-ons for – but built into a single Node.js service. For example, if you have a LangChain agent that’s working in development, Portkey can help turn it into a globally distributed service with _“single-digit millisecond latencies globally”_ and high uptime. Again, building such an edge-optimized gateway in Python would be difficult because Cloudflare Workers and similar platforms do not natively support Python (at least not without heavy WebAssembly shims). By using TS, Portkey demonstrates the **advantage of aligning with modern infrastructure** and shows that performance-critical AI middleware can be built in a high-level language without resorting to Rust.
    
-   **VoltAgent (TypeScript):** Mentioned earlier, VoltAgent is an open source TS framework for AI agents, emphasizing multi-agent orchestration with good developer experience. It provides a core engine (`@voltagent/core`) to define agents with roles, tools, and memory, plus the concept of **“Supervisors”** to coordinate multiple agents (essentially letting agents form teams) ([github.com](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent#:~:text=,world%20tasks.%20Supports)). It also supports extensions like voice interaction, standardized tool APIs via the Model Context Protocol, and a visual debugging UI. While Python frameworks like LangChain have some of these pieces, VoltAgent integrates them in a TypeScript context. A Python counterpart in spirit might be something like **SuperAGI** or **LangChain with agents**, but VoltAgent is bringing those ideas to the Node.js ecosystem, allowing Node developers to build complex agent systems without switching languages.
    
-   **Agentic.js (TypeScript):** There is also a growing collection of TypeScript SDKs and libraries. For example, **Agentic** (by [transitive-bullshit on GitHub](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/agentic)) is a standard library of AI “tools” that work across multiple TS agent frameworks. It provides ready-made tool integrations (like a Weather API client, etc.) that you can plug into any LLM agent written in TS. This mirrors how the Python world has many tools integrated in LangChain or via OpenAI functions; Agentic is making sure TypeScript has an equivalent set so developers don’t have to reinvent the wheel for common agent capabilities. It even has adapters for different AI SDKs (Vercel AI SDK, LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc.), underscoring how the TS ecosystem is **converging** – you can mix and match components more easily.
    
In comparison, the **Python agent ecosystem** is rich but perhaps more fragmented. LangChain is the 800-lb gorilla, but we also have others like **LangGraph** (for state machine style agents), Microsoft’s **AutoGen** (multi-agent conversations, in Python), and research-centric platforms like **CAMEL** or **Hugging Face Transformers Agents**. Many of these Python tools excel at quick prototyping or specific niches (e.g. AutoGen for agents that write each other’s code). However, when it comes to _productionizing_ these systems, developers often end up writing a lot of custom glue in Python, or dealing with issues like scaling server endpoints, adding monitoring, etc. The TypeScript tools we’ve discussed (Mastra, Portkey, VoltAgent) explicitly target that production gap by leveraging frameworks and practices from the web development world.

**Summary of Framework Landscape:** Python still has the _breadth_ of libraries (and many new research ideas get released as Python code first), but **TypeScript now has a full complement of agent frameworks and SDKs** that cover everything from high-level workflow design to low-level infrastructure. This means teams can choose TypeScript without sacrificing functionality. If you’re already a seasoned JavaScript/TypeScript developer, you likely won’t find any area _“where Python is strictly superior”_ for building an AI chatbot or agent, and _“if you do, you can always mix in a single Python function”_ in a pinch thanks to serverless microservices. That pragmatic approach – use TS for 95% of the app, and maybe call a Python service for a specialized ML task – is becoming more common.

## Where Python Still Prevails (and How the Languages Complement Each Other)

Given all these TypeScript advantages, it’s important to recognize that **Python isn’t going anywhere** in AI. In fact, Python is _reigning supreme in the AI/ML domain in 2025_, and for good reasons:

-   **Machine Learning & Training**: Virtually all cutting-edge model development and training happens in Python. Libraries like **TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn** and many research codebases are Python-first or Python-only. If you need to fine-tune a transformer, perform data science, or implement a new model architecture, Python is usually the best tool. Its ecosystem of scientific computing (NumPy, Pandas) and visualization is unmatched. Python remains the go-to language for AI and ML development with libraries that provide powerful tools for building everything from recommendation engines to self-driving cars. TypeScript simply does not have equivalent libraries for model training at scale (there is no TypeScript TensorFlow for training large models with GPUs; JavaScript can train small models, but that’s the exception, not the rule).
    
-   **Prototyping & Experimentation**: Python’s simplicity and the prevalence of Jupyter notebooks make it ideal for quickly testing ideas. A researcher might spin up a notebook, use LangChain or simple openAI API calls, and prototype an agent workflow in a very short time. The iterative, interactive nature of Python is a huge asset during R&D. TypeScript, which is compiled and typically run in a more structured environment, can be a bit heavier for quick experiments (though tools like Node’s `ts-node` and Jupyter-like environments for Node are improving). This is why we often see initial agent ideas built in Python, and only later ported or re-engineered in TypeScript for production.
    
-   **Advanced AI Integrations**: If your agent needs to use a sophisticated ML model or technique not available in JavaScript, Python will be involved. For example, high-end vector similarity search might leverage FAISS (a C++ library with Python bindings). Or an agent that does image processing with deep learning will rely on OpenCV or PIL in Python. While JavaScript has some ML and CV capabilities (e.g., TensorFlow.js, opencv.js via WASM), they lag behind in performance and features for these heavy tasks. In such cases, teams may decide to run those specific components in Python services while the orchestrator or interface is in TypeScript.
    
-   **Community and Knowledge Base**: The AI community still produces the majority of examples, papers, and blog posts in Python. If you’re troubleshooting an agent’s prompt engineering or looking for a how-to on using a new OpenAI function calling feature, you’re likely to find Python snippets first. Python’s huge mindshare means any new API (like OpenAI’s functions or Anthropic’s context features) will have Python SDK support day one, and TypeScript support either concurrently or a bit later. This isn’t a _technical_ advantage per se, but it affects developer velocity. Thankfully, the gap is closing as more folks share TypeScript examples, but it’s something to be aware of.
    

In many cases, **Python and TypeScript can complement each other** in an end-to-end AI solution. A plausible architecture is: Python for the **ML pipeline** (training models, doing data-heavy tasks offline, maintaining ML ops), and TypeScript for the **application pipeline** (orchestrating those models in a live system, building the UI, handling concurrent requests). For instance, you might train a custom LLM or fine-tune on domain data using Python, and then deploy the model and use it via a TypeScript service for the user-facing agent. This is similar to how in web dev you might use Python for some data analysis or backend tasks but use Node/TS for the frontend and client-facing APIs.

It’s also worth noting that Python is evolving to address some of its limitations – e.g., efforts to remove the GIL (in CPython or via alternate runtimes), better static typing with projects like Pyright/mypy (Python now has type hinting, though not enforcement like TS), and frameworks to simplify async (like asyncio improvements, or using async libraries that abstract away the boilerplate). So the gap may narrow. But as of 2025, when it comes to _agentic AI systems in production_, TypeScript has the momentum.

To quote a comment from the Portkey team’s retrospective: _“While we could have gone with Python (the familiar choice in AI) or Rust (the performance king), choosing TypeScript struck the perfect balance between development speed, performance, and maintainability”_. This nicely encapsulates the trade-off: Python = familiarity & rich ML ecosystem, Rust = ultimate performance but low-level, and TypeScript sitting in between, offering excellent performance _and_ high productivity for building complex systems.

## Conclusion

The rise of TypeScript in multi-agent AI systems reflects a broader shift in how AI applications are built and deployed. As AI moves from research labs and isolated scripts into **scalable, user-facing applications**, the engineering requirements have evolved. TypeScript, with its powerful concurrency, robust tooling, and seamless integration into web infrastructure, has proven itself as a capable choice for orchestrating intelligent agents at scale.

**Python remains indispensable** – it’s the language in which AI models are born and initially experimented with. For pure machine learning workflows, one might say “Python is the soil in which AI grows.” But when it’s time to build a full product around those AI capabilities, developers are increasingly grafting that AI onto the “tree” of a TypeScript application. In these agentic systems, Python might handle the brain (training models, heavy compute), while TypeScript handles the central nervous system and limbs – coordinating actions, interacting with users, and scaling across the cloud.

In deciding between Python and TypeScript for an AI project, it ultimately comes down to the use case:

-   If you are doing heavy **ML development or data science**, Python is your friend – perhaps prototyping your agent in a notebook and leveraging the rich AI libraries.
-   If you are building a **high-concurrency AI service, a web application with AI features, or an orchestrator for many model calls**, TypeScript offers a scalable and developer-friendly path.
    
-   Often, the answer will be **both**: use each language where it plays to its strengths. If your core is serverless and web-oriented, go TypeScript, and if you come into any area where Python is strictly superior you can mix in a single Python function on the side.
    
The key is that we now have a choice. A few years ago, a multi-agent AI system almost certainly meant a Python backend. Today, one can build an equally powerful system in TypeScript – and perhaps have an easier time deploying and maintaining it in a web-scale environment. With the continual improvements in both ecosystems, the future likely holds even more integration (imagine stronger Python↔TS interop, or more AI frameworks dual-targeting both languages).

**In the end, the languages are tools**. What’s exciting is that agentic AI is pushing the boundaries of both. Python is becoming more production-friendly, and TypeScript is becoming more AI-savvy. For developers and organizations, this means more flexibility to choose the right tool for each part of the puzzle. And for users, it means AI agents that are faster, more reliable, and more seamlessly embedded in the applications they use everyday – whether those agents were coded in `def` or `function` is becoming just an implementation detail.

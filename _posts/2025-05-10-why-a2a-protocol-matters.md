title: "Why the Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol Matters"

---


The rise of task-oriented _AI agents_ has been one of the defining trends of the past two years. Small, specialized bots now draft emails, reconcile invoices, schedule meetings, and even write code. Yet these helpers still struggle to _work together_. One finance agent might live inside Google Cloud; an HR agent could be hosted on Microsoft Azure; a CRM bot might run inside Salesforce. When workflows cross those boundaries, developers are forced to glue systems together with brittle REST bridges or prompt-copy-paste hacks.

Google’s **Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol** aims to remove that glue code by giving every compliant agent a common “language” for discovery, authentication, task management, and streaming updates. In other words, it wants to be the HTTP of the agentic world, letting bots hand work to one another as naturally as web servers share hyper-links. Google [introduced](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/) the open standard last month with support from more than 50 technology partners ranging from Atlassian and Box to Workday and MongoDB.

### A2A in One Sentence

_A2A is an open, JSON-RPC-based protocol that lets any “client” agent discover, authenticate, and communicate with any “remote” agent—regardless of the framework, model, or cloud that powers each side._


## From Single Agents to Multi-Agent Ecosystems

Early agent projects focused on the _solo_ use-case: one large language model reasoning through a user request, then calling out to a tool. Frameworks such as LangChain, AutoGen, and CrewAI flourished by helping developers define what those tools look like and how the model should call them.

The moment an agent needed to **delegate** a whole sub-task—say, “book me a flight” or “generate a legal contract”—things became messy. Tool schemas (even sophisticated ones like Anthropic’s **Model Context Protocol, MCP**) were never designed to handle long-running, back-and-forth exchanges between two autonomous programs. As Google’s engineering team noted in its launch post, an ecosystem of “opaque” agents requires a higher-level handshake that MCP purposely avoids. A2A fills that gap and, in Google’s words, _complements_ rather than replaces MCP.

## Core Principles Behind A2A

1.  **Long-Running Tasks**  
    A2A treats a task as a finite-state machine that can span minutes, hours, or days. Agents send _status_ events (submitted → working → completed/failed) over a streaming channel so both sides stay in sync.
    
2.  **Modality Agnostic**  
    Text is just one channel. The specification allows audio and video parts to flow inside the same stream, making it possible to hand off media-heavy jobs like video clipping or customer-call analysis.
    
3.  **Capability Discovery**  
    Every remote agent publishes an **Agent Card**—a small JSON file (usually hosted at `/.well-known/agent.json`) that advertises its skills, required authentication, and preferred input/output modes. A client reads that card before deciding which agent is best equipped for the next step.
    
4.  **Security First**  
    Enterprise-grade authentication schemes—API keys, OAuth, or mutual TLS—are baked into the spec instead of grafted on later. The card can also be signed with JWS so that clients can verify provenance.
    
5.  **Open by Design**  
    Built on HTTP, JSON-RPC 2.0, and Server-Sent Events (SSE), the protocol slides into existing infrastructure without exotic brokers or proprietary SDKs.
    

These principles draw heavily on Google’s internal experience running massive multi-agent systems, but the goal is a neutral spec that any vendor can implement and extend. The public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/A2A/blob/main/README.md) already contains reference servers, a TypeScript code-generator, and a Python SDK to jump-start adoption.

## A Guided Tour of the Wire Format

### 1. Discovery

A client fetches the remote agent’s card:
`GET https://travel-planner.example/.well-known/agent.json` 

If the card lists a capability tag like `"flight_search"` and supports an auth method the client can satisfy, the client proceeds.

### 2. Task Initiation

The client creates a _task_ with a unique ID and an initial **Message** object. That message can contain multiple _parts_: plain text, JSON data, even binary blobs referenced by URI.

`{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tasks/sendSubscribe",
  "params": {
    "id": "uuid-1234",
    "message": {
      "role": "user",
      "parts": [
        { "type": "text", "text": "Find non-stop flights to Tokyo May 15-20" }
      ]
    }
  }
}` 

`sendSubscribe` opens an SSE stream so the client receives _TaskStatusUpdateEvent_ messages as they happen.

### 3. Interaction

If the remote agent needs clarification—“Are connections acceptable?”—it returns `state: input-required` along with a prompt. The client answers by sending another _Message_ referencing the same task ID.

### 4. Completion & Artifacts

Upon success, the remote sends `state: completed` plus one or more **Artifact** objects: JSON itineraries, PDFs, images, etc. The stream ends with `final: true`.

All of this happens without exposing the remote agent’s internal prompts, memories, or tool lists, preserving both IP and security.

## How A2A and MCP Fit Together

Anthropic’s **MCP** standard focuses on the _vertical_ axis: a single agent invokes external tools and data sources, each described via a JSON schema. A2A operates on the _horizontal_ axis: agents invoke _other agents_ as first-class peers.

Think of a repair shop scenario sketched in Google’s documentation:

-   **Diagnostics Agent** (connected to car sensors via MCP) discovers an oil leak.
    
-   It pings a **Parts-Ordering Agent** via A2A to check stock.
    
-   That agent, in turn, calls a **Supplier API** through its own MCP tool schema.
    

In this stack, MCP lets each agent reach _resources_, while A2A lets those agents reach _one another_. Both layers are needed for complex workflows, and Google explicitly recommends “MCP for tools, A2A for agents”.


## The Emerging Ecosystem

### Cloud Providers

-   **Google Cloud** baked A2A into the new **Vertex AI Agent Engine** and open-sourced an **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** that builds agents in under 100 lines of code. 
-   **Microsoft** [announced](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/blog/2025/05/07/empowering-multi-agent-apps-with-the-open-agent2agent-a2a-protocol/) that Azure AI Foundry and Copilot Studio will speak A2A, allowing agents in Microsoft’s stack to invoke external counterparts—or vice versa—across cloud boundaries. 
    

### SaaS & Platform Vendors

Salesforce, SAP, PayPal, and ServiceNow have all pledged support. Imagine a Salesforce _Lead-Enrichment Agent_ automatically chatting with a PayPal _Payment-Risk Agent_ before approving a new subscription—no middleware required.

### System Integrators

Accenture, Deloitte, Capgemini, and Wipro see A2A as a shortcut to multi-agent architectures for supply-chain planning, employee onboarding, and customer service. Their early proofs of concept suggest that A2A can reduce integration timelines by weeks. 


## Real-World Scenarios

1.  **Recruiting Pipeline**  
    A _Talent-Sourcer Agent_ scans LinkedIn, a _Resume-Screening Agent_ ranks candidates, and a _Scheduler Agent_ books interviews—all coordinated through A2A so each agent can run on the best cloud for its specialty.
    
2.  **Dynamic Pricing**  
    Revionics is prototyping a multi-agent system where a _Pricing Agent_ collaborates with a _Demand-Forecast Agent_ and a _Competitor-Monitoring Agent_ to adjust retail prices hourly.
    
3.  **IT Incident Response**  
    A monitoring bot detects an anomaly, then passes context to a _Root-Cause Agent_; that agent reaches a _Config-Management Agent_ to propose a fix, which a human approves in Slack. Because each step is a discrete agent speaking A2A, companies can swap vendors without refactoring the pipeline.
    
## Addressing Security & Governance

Large organizations will not expose production systems to anonymous agents. A2A tackles that skepticism head-on:

-   **Signed Agent Cards**—Clients “pin” a vendor’s public key; any tampering invalidates the signature.
    
-   **Role-Based API Keys**—A remote can demand a _minimum_ or _maximum_ scope, preventing over-permissive access.
    
-   **Auditability**—Because every TaskStatusUpdateEvent is a discrete JSON object, observability tools can trace end-to-end flows with OpenTelemetry.
    

Google’s own implementation runs on mutual TLS by default, and the reference servers log every state transition for compliance. 


## What Comes Next?

-   **Registries** – Today, discovery relies on URLs or private catalogs. Community members have proposed DNS-based registries that scan for `/.well-known/agent.json` and surface signed results in a searchable index.
    
-   **Schema Negotiation** – The spec allows content negotiation for parts (JSON, markdown, video), but real agents still hard-code formats. Expect a future version to formalize MIME negotiation.
    
-   **Federated Intelligence** – Edge devices (cars, factories, satellites) could host on-prem agents that speak A2A over Web-Sockets, forming _federations_ that share insights without centralizing data.
    
## Final Thoughts

Protocols change industries when they hide complexity behind a simple abstraction—TCP/IP made packet routing invisible; HTTP turned document sharing into a one-liner; Kubernetes hides container orchestration behind `kubectl apply`. **A2A has the potential to do the same for multi-agent systems**, letting specialized bots collaborate without custom bridges or prompt gymnastics.

Whether that vision materializes depends on real-world adoption. But with heavyweight cloud vendors, SaaS leaders, and integrators already shipping early releases, the odds look favorable. For developers, architects, and product teams, now is the ideal moment to read the spec, wire up a demo, and imagine what workflows could look like when _every agent can meet in the hallway, shake hands, and get to work._

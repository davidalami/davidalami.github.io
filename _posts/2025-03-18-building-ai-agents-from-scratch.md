title: "How to Build AI Agents from Scratch"
---


Artificial intelligence has rapidly evolved from abstract theory to hands-on application, and one of its most exciting areas is the development of  **AI agents** - computational systems that can perceive their environment, reason about it, and act toward specified goals. Today, building an AI agent often involves combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with orchestrations (like the ReAct prompt technique), memory, knowledge retrieval, and external tools for tasks such as searching the web, reading from databases, or even controlling hardware. Below is an in-depth look at why agents matter, how they work, the key pieces needed to assemble them, and where to go for further learning.

# Why AI Agents Matter

In short, AI agents automate tasks, provide intelligent decision-making, and reduce the need for direct supervision. They can read, plan, and execute instructions to complete complicated projects, such as:

-   Searching the web for up-to-date information
-   Writing and debugging code
-   Analyzing financial data and generating forecasts
-   Managing schedules and sending email reminders

In each of these tasks, LLMs like GPT-4o or Claude can reason about goals and produce step-by-step plans. However, LLMs can’t do it all alone. They need supporting structures like:

**Tools**: These are external functions or APIs the agent can call to retrieve specific data or execute commands.

**Memory**: A way to store relevant pieces of information (like a conversation or a user’s preferences).

**Knowledge**: Additional context that can be retrieved from local or remote sources, including vector databases for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

**Orchestration Logic**: The approach that coordinates the AI’s reasoning loop. Common orchestration patterns include ReAct (short for “Reason+Act”), which encourages the model to plan a response iteratively.

# Key Concepts to Understand

# 1. LLMs as the Brain

Large Language Models such as GPT-4o, Claude, or open-source ones like Mistral or Llama function as the “thinking” part of an agent. They parse input and generate responses, often leveraging advanced token-based probability distributions. When building from scratch, developers usually write the prompts that guide the LLM. This includes specifying the task, constraints, or style to ensure consistent and relevant outputs.

# 2. Tools and Function Calling

Modern AI agents often need to fetch data or perform real-world actions. For instance, an agent that answers financial questions might call a stock-tracking API. Tools (or “functions”) let the agent go beyond text-based predictions. It can look up weather information, fetch inventory stats, or run an OS command. Some frameworks rely on “function calling,” a structured method where the LLM calls specific functions with validated JSON arguments, enabling safe and predictable operations.

# 3. Memory and Knowledge Storage

Agents running over multiple steps need to remember what’s happening. Memory can be as simple as storing a few lines of conversation or as advanced as a vector-based memory that uses embeddings to identify relevant data points from entire libraries of text. A popular approach is storing documents in vector databases (like Pinecone, LanceDB, or others) and retrieving them based on similarity scores. This method is referred to as  **RAG**  (Retrieval Augmented Generation).

# 4. Orchestration Patterns

Although LLMs can generate sophisticated responses in a single shot, real complexity emerges when building multi-step or multi-agent systems. The “ReAct” architecture, for example, has the model reason about what action to take next, then carry it out, then reflect on the result before proceeding. This leads to more coherent conversation or solution paths.

# 5. Multi-Agent Systems

Some advanced setups run multiple agents in parallel, each with its own specialty. For example, one agent might handle code generation, another might do web research, while a third might test or debug. These agents communicate with one another — or with an orchestrator agent — passing messages around until the final task is complete. Projects like the  [GenAI Agents repository](https://github.com/NirDiamant/GenAI_Agents)  provide in-depth multi-agent tutorials and reference architectures.

# Steps to Build an AI Agent from Scratch

Below is a simplified overview of how to create an AI agent using a minimal approach. Specific libraries often abstract these steps, but understanding the fundamentals is vital.

1.  **Select an LLM**  
    Choose an LLM that best suits the domain. It could be GPT-o3-mini for advanced text analysis, Claude for broad conversational tasks, or a specialized model from the  [Hugging Face platform](https://huggingface.co/)  if open-source is a priority. Be sure the model’s limitations match your budget and compliance needs.
2.  **Define the Agent’s Core Loop**

-   **Initialize**: Provide your LLM with a system prompt or context that states the agent’s overall role. For example: “You are a helpful coding assistant that can also check the weather.”
-   **Read**: The agent reads user input (or environment data).
-   **Reason**: The agent decides if it needs to call a tool, consult memory, or produce a final answer.
-   **Act**: If necessary, the agent calls a function, queries a search API, or updates memory.
-   **Reflect**: If the result is partial, the agent repeats the reason-act-reflect loop.

**3. Incorporate Tools**  
Implement or integrate specific APIs. For instance, if the agent needs to check the weather, create a function  `get_weather(location)`  that the LLM can call. If you’re using the ReAct pattern, the agent might reason: “I need the weather for New York. Let me call the get_weather function.” It then passes the location string to your function, and upon receiving the answer, it merges it into a response to the user.

**4. Add Memory and Knowledge**  
If the project demands extensive referencing (e.g., summarizing large documents, or retrieving user preferences across sessions), store relevant data in a vector database. The agent should have a method to query its memory.

**5. Test the Agent**  
Write test cases for expected user queries. Confirm that the agent can handle them gracefully:

-   Simple queries that need a direct answer
-   Tool-based queries
-   Questions that require memory of past interactions
-   Edge cases where the agent might produce errors

**6. Refine and Improve**  
Once the agent works in principle, measure its performance, look for errors, and refine prompts, memory strategies, or function-calling logic. If the LLM is responding incorrectly, you might tweak your system prompt, break tasks into smaller steps, or incorporate better error handling.

**7. Deploy**  
Depending on the use case, you can deploy your agent as a web service, a command-line interface, or even a desktop application. Continuous monitoring is critical since generative models occasionally produce unexpected outputs.

# Tips on Getting Started

1.  **Start with a Single-Tool Agent**  
    If the concept of orchestrating multiple calls is confusing, begin by letting the agent call just one function (like a single weather API). Once you’re comfortable with that, add more tools, such as a web scraper or database query function.
2.  **Use a Reproducible Environment**  
    If possible, develop inside containers or use consistent environment managers (for example, Conda). This ensures your dependencies, including LLM interfaces, remain stable as the project evolves.
3.  **Keep the First Prompt Simple**  
    When writing the system or initial prompt, be direct about the agent’s purpose: “You are a code-generation assistant with access to a function for reading GitHub issues.” Over time, refine and expand the prompt for new functionalities.
4.  **Modularize the Code**  
    Separate your code by concern:

-   “Agent Logic” for the core loop
-   “Tools” for external function calls
-   “Memory” for storing conversation
-   “UI or CLI” for interacting with users This modularity prevents confusion as your agent grows in complexity.

**5. Monitor Logs Thoroughly**  
As the agent cycles through reasoning, tool calls, and reflections, it may produce logs or a chain-of-thought. Examine these logs to verify the agent is performing tasks correctly. This debugging step is crucial.

**6. Utilize Community Knowledge**  
If you’re stuck, exploring open-source examples is highly beneficial.

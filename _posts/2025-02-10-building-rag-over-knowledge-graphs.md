title: "Building Knowledge Graphs for Intelligent Applications"
---


In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced data processing and complex problem-solving capabilities. One promising approach is the integration of LLMs in retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems—architectures that combine LLMs with external data sources to provide contextually enriched answers to user queries. This article presents a comprehensive guide on leveraging LLMs alongside graph databases and other data structures, with a focus on constructing and utilizing knowledge graphs to build intelligent, context-aware applications.

----------

## The RAG Paradigm: Beyond Simple LLM Interactions

A basic LLM interaction consists of the following steps:

1.  **User Query:** An application accepts input from the user.
2.  **LLM Processing:** The input is processed by an LLM, which generates a response.
3.  **Response Delivery:** The answer is returned to the user.

While this cycle is well understood, a more sophisticated approach enriches the process by integrating external data sources (which is retrieval augmented generation). In this enhanced workflow, the application first performs an information retrieval operation—using techniques such as vector search or by transforming natural language into structured query languages—before feeding the retrieved context to the LLM. This additional context allows the LLM to produce more informed and accurate responses.
In a RAG workflow, several layers of data and functionality must be managed:
-   **User Input Handling:** The system receives queries and processes them appropriately.
-   **Data Integration:** External data, whether structured (tables, CSV files) or unstructured (PDFs, plain text), must be incorporated to provide additional context.
-   **LLM Characteristics:** The specific capabilities of the LLM determine how well it can utilize the provided context.

----------

## Structured vs. Unstructured Data

Within the context of building a knowledge graph-based RAG system, data is typically divided into three categories:

### 1. Unstructured Data

This category encompasses text files and multimedia content (which can be converted to text). When working with unstructured data, the challenge is to perform efficient information retrieval. The typical steps include:

-   **Chunking:** Dividing the text into manageable pieces.
-   **Vector Embedding:** Converting these chunks into numerical vectors for similarity comparison.
-   **Vector Search:** Retrieving the most relevant chunks based on a user query.

### 2. Structured Data

Enterprises often manage structured data within data warehouses, CSV files, or databases. For instance, publicly available SEC filings (such as Form 10-K or Form 13F) contain structured information about companies and their investments. Retrieval from such sources often involves:

-   **Direct Querying:** Transforming natural language queries into structured query languages like SQL.
-   **Domain-Specific Searches:** Allowing precise queries that incorporate parameters such as investment amounts or share counts.

### 3. Hybrid Data (Knowledge Graphs)

By combining unstructured and structured data, one can create a unified data model known as a Knowledge Graph. Knowledge graphs enable richer query capabilities and advanced context expansion by:
-   **Extracting Nodes:** Representing text chunks or key entities as nodes.
-   **Creating Relationships:** Linking these nodes with edges that reflect real-world associations (e.g., sequential text relationships or investment connections).
-   **Enhancing Context:** Adding metadata and summaries to facilitate nuanced searches.

----------

## Constructing a Knowledge Graph: A Step-by-Step Approach

Building a knowledge graph in the context of RAG applications involves several key steps:

### 1. Begin with the Minimum Viable Graph

Start small rather than designing an overly complex schema from the outset. The recommended strategy is to:

-   **Identify Core Information:** Determine the essential data required to answer initial queries.
-   **Build a Minimal Graph:** Create nodes representing text chunks or key entities, even if they are not yet richly interconnected.
-   **Maintain Order with a Linked List:** For text data, preserve the original document sequence by linking chunks in order. Each chunk is enriched with a vector embedding to support vector search operations.

### 2. Enhance and Connect Nodes

Once the minimal graph is in place, the next step is to enrich and interconnect the data:

-   **Add Parent Relationships:** Associate each text chunk with its parent document to maintain metadata integrity.
-   **Generate Summaries:** Use the LLM to create summaries of related chunks, storing these summaries with their own vector embeddings. This provides alternative access patterns for queries requiring broader context.
-   **Create Edges:** Introduce relationships between nodes. For example, in a financial data model, connect nodes representing management companies to nodes representing public companies. Relationships can also store properties like the number of shares owned or investment values.

### 3. Leverage Pattern Matching and Query Languages

Graph databases, especially those following the property graph model, excel at pattern matching. Languages like Cypher offer:

-   **Clear Expression of Relationships:** Rather than performing complex table joins, pattern matching allows for intuitive queries across connected nodes.
-   **Handling of Complex Queries:** For instance, queries can identify management companies linked to specific investments or locate companies within a given geographic region by matching address nodes.

### 4. Integrate Geospatial Data

Incorporating geospatial information further expands the knowledge graph’s capabilities:

-   **Geospatial Indexing:** Use specialized indexes for location-based queries, determining “nearness” (e.g., within 50 km) or grouping data by city or county.
-   **Hybrid Strategies:** Combine pattern matching with geospatial queries to answer complex location-based questions (for example, “Which companies are near Santa Clara?”).

### 5. Iterative Development and Continuous Enrichment

Constructing a knowledge graph is an iterative process:

-   **Evaluation-Driven Development:** As new queries are tested, gaps in the graph may be identified that require additional nodes or relationships.
-   **User Feedback Integration:** End-user feedback (e.g., through rating mechanisms) can guide further enhancements.
-   **Adaptive Strategies:** Begin with specific query strategies and expand them as real-world usage reveals additional requirements.

----------

## Querying the Knowledge Graph: Combining Techniques

Once a knowledge graph is established, multiple query strategies can be applied to extract information:

### Vector Search for Unstructured Data

For text-based queries:

-   **Retrieval Queries:** Use vector embeddings to identify similar text chunks. A “context window” can be implemented to include neighboring chunks, ensuring that responses have sufficient context.
-   **LLM-Enhanced Retrieval:** After vector search, the retrieved text is passed to the LLM for answer generation. Experimenting with different strategies can help identify the most effective method.

### Direct Pattern Matching via Cypher

For structured data and interconnected nodes:

-   **Cypher Queries:** Translating natural language queries into Cypher allows for direct pattern matching on nodes and relationships. For example, a query might search for a management company with a specific investment in a public company.
-   **Schema-Driven Generation:** Providing the LLM with a detailed schema and examples can help it generate accurate Cypher queries automatically. Iterative refinement ensures that generated queries are both syntactically and semantically correct.

### Combining Structured and Unstructured Queries

A powerful aspect of this approach is merging the strengths of both vector search and structured querying:

-   **Multi-Strategy Execution:** Depending on the user query, the system may choose to perform a vector search, execute a Cypher query, or combine both. For instance, a question about “companies at risk of chip shortages” might start with a vector search for relevant filings and then transition to pattern matching to extract investor data.
-   **Context Expansion:** Retrieval processes can traverse the graph. For example, if a text chunk is linked to a specific company filing, the system can follow that connection to fetch related investor information and deliver a comprehensive answer.

----------

## Practical Challenges and Design Considerations

### Data Preparation and Chunking

Data preparation is a critical first step:

-   **Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Raw data (such as SEC filings in complex XML formats) must be cleaned and processed to extract useful content.
-   **Chunk Size and Overlap:** Determining the optimal chunk size is crucial. While token limits are a starting point, the primary goal is to create chunks that support effective similarity search. A typical chunk might be 2,000 characters, though this depends on the embedding model.
-   **Preserving Document Order:** Linking chunks in sequence helps maintain context, enabling both forward and backward navigation through the original document.

### Graph Modeling Strategies

Graph databases require a different approach compared to relational databases:

-   **Minimal Viable Graph:** Start small by creating only the necessary nodes and relationships, then expand as needed.
-   **Avoid Over-Engineering:** Resist the temptation to design an overly complex schema from the start. Allow real-world queries to guide further development.
-   **Bundling Information:** In some cases, grouping related information into larger nodes can improve query performance by reducing the number of traversals.

### Query Performance and Indexing

Performance considerations are paramount when dealing with large graphs:

-   **Vector Search Performance:** While vector search is effective for similarity matching, it can be computationally intensive if performed without indexing. Techniques like dimensionality reduction (e.g., principal component analysis) can be applied, though these are lossy transforms that must balance performance gains with the preservation of semantic information.
-   **Geospatial Indexing:** Specialized indexes for geospatial data accelerate location-based queries.
-   **Relationship Density:** The efficiency of a graph query is often proportional to the number of relationships traversed. Careful graph modeling can minimize unnecessary joins and improve performance.

### LLM-Assisted Query Generation and Validation

A promising strategy is to use LLMs not only for generating natural language responses but also for creating structured queries:

-   **Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning:** Out-of-the-box models such as GPT-3.5 Turbo can often generate Cypher queries from natural language prompts. Performance improves when detailed context, including schema information, is provided.
-   **Iterative Refinement:** Once a query is generated, additional validation steps can ensure its correctness. For example, rule-based systems may check for destructive operations and syntax issues, and further refinement can be achieved by having the LLM review the generated output.
-   **Automatic Correction:** Although it is conceivable for an LLM to validate its own output, combining automated validation with additional human or rule-based checks has proven more reliable.

## A Practical Example

Using a toolchain that includes LangChain and Neo4j, text chunks are stored with their vector embeddings, enabling retrieval queries that expand context windows. Key elements of the implementation include:

### Using LangChain with Neo4j

-   **Configuration:** The pipeline is configured to treat Neo4j as a vector store, where text chunks are indexed by their embeddings.
-   **Retrieval Query Patterns:** Different approaches are employed:
    -   A simple vector search retrieves relevant text chunks.
    -   A retrieval query that collects neighboring chunks (a “context window”) ensures comprehensive context.
    -   More advanced strategies traverse from unstructured text nodes to structured nodes—such as linking a financial filing to its corresponding investor data—to address multifaceted questions.

### Generating Cypher Queries with an LLM

-   **Schema-Driven Query Generation:** By providing the LLM with a detailed schema and sample queries, it is possible to generate Cypher queries from natural language prompts. This can facilitate tasks like pattern matching and extracting relationships from the graph.
-   **Iterative Process:** As queries become more complex, iterative refinement and validation ensure that the generated queries are both syntactically correct and semantically meaningful.

### Combining Multiple Access Patterns

-   **Multi-Modal Queries:** The system can execute several query strategies for the same user question. For example, one strategy might return companies based on vector search, while another might extract investor data via pattern matching. Comparing results from different methods helps determine which approach yields the most accurate and useful answer.

## Addressing Common Challenges

Several important challenges arise when integrating LLMs with graph databases:

### Dimensionality Reduction for Text Chunk Data

-   **Challenge:** Is it possible to apply techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of text embeddings for faster queries?
-   **Consideration:** Dimensionality reduction can indeed accelerate similarity searches by working with lower-dimensional data. However, since this process is lossy, it is essential to balance performance gains with the preservation of semantic richness.

### Granularity in Graph Modeling

-   **Challenge:** How can a graph structure be extracted and maintained from complex, unstructured texts (for example, literary works) where relationships are not explicitly defined?
-   **Approach:** Begin by chunking the text and establishing a basic linked list. Then, employ natural language processing pipelines to extract names, dates, locations, and events. Over time, refine the graph by introducing additional relationships or hierarchical structures based on the types of queries users pose.

### Auto-Generation and Validation of Cypher Queries

-   **Challenge:** Can an LLM generate a Cypher query from a natural language prompt and also validate its correctness?
-   **Solution:** While LLMs can generate Cypher queries in both zero-shot and few-shot modes, it is advisable to use a rule-based system to validate syntax and prevent destructive operations. Additional rounds of refinement and validation ensure that the generated queries accurately reflect the intended query logic.

### Scaling and Graph Partitioning

-   **Challenge:** How can scalability be maintained, and what strategies can be used for effective graph partitioning in large knowledge graphs?
-   **Strategy:** Graph partitioning is inherently challenging, as optimal partitioning depends on the types of queries being executed. A common approach is rule-based partitioning, using natural divisions such as geography or time to ensure that most queries remain localized. This minimizes cross-machine joins and helps maintain performance as the graph scales.

## Embracing Complexity and Opportunity

Integrating LLMs with graph databases within a RAG framework enables the development of precise, context-aware applications. By combining the strengths of unstructured text retrieval with the structured precision of graph databases, developers can create systems that deliver richer, more accurate answers to user queries.

Key takeaways include:

-   **Iterative Graph Construction:** Begin with a minimal graph and expand as real-world queries reveal additional needs.
-   **Multiple Query Strategies:** Utilize vector search, pattern matching, and geospatial queries based on context. Often, combining these methods yields the best results.
-   **LLM Assistance:** Employ LLMs for generating both natural language responses and structured queries (e.g., Cypher). Ensure validation through iterative refinement.
-   **User-Centric Design:** Focus on designing systems that provide seamless access and navigation, whether via chat interfaces or traditional paging mechanisms.
-   **Performance Optimization:** Balance data granularity with query performance by leveraging indexing strategies for both vector and geospatial data.

As the line between structured and unstructured data continues to blur, intelligent systems that can navigate both realms become increasingly essential. The techniques and strategies discussed here serve as a robust framework for developing applications that harness the power of both LLMs and graph databases.

## Conclusion

Integrating LLMs with graph databases in a RAG workflow represents an exciting frontier in data-driven application development. By constructing knowledge graphs that seamlessly combine unstructured and structured data, developers can enhance context, improve query accuracy, and ultimately deliver better answers to users.

The journey from simple vector searches to complex, multi-strategy queries involves understanding data at every level—from raw text to structured relationships. Whether you are developing a financial analysis tool based on SEC filings or building an interactive literary analysis application, these principles provide a strong foundation for getting started. As research and experimentation continue, further innovations in blending LLM capabilities with advanced graph query techniques are expected to push the boundaries of what intelligent applications can achieve.

By embracing the complexities of real-world data and harnessing the power of both LLMs and graph databases, developers are well positioned to create applications that are not only technically advanced but also highly useful for end users. Continuous iterative development and user feedback will drive ongoing improvements, ensuring that intelligent systems remain adaptable to evolving challenges and opportunities.

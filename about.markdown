**Email:** [davidalami@gmail.com](mailto:davidalami@gmail.com)  
**Location:** Remote  
**LinkedIn:** [David Alami, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-alami-phd-813aa9101/)  

## About Me  
I’m a Machine Learning Engineer with a PhD in Technical Sciences and over 15 years of combined R&D and commercial experience. My focus is building intelligent systems powered by cutting-edge NLP and large language models. From custom LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to scalable, end-to-end AI pipelines, I deliver solutions that transform messy data into real-world products.

My work bridges research and deployment — I’ve led high-impact AI projects across domains, crafted open-source tools, and ranked among top performers in global ML competitions. I thrive in autonomous, problem-solving roles where I can architect and implement agentic AI systems from the ground up.

## Core Expertise  
- **Natural Language Processing:** Building LLM-driven products for conversational agents, search, classification, and text analytics.  
- **Custom LLMs & RAG Systems:** Designing domain-adapted models and integrating them with retrieval-based pipelines.   
- **Research to Product:** Translating cutting-edge NLP research into deployable, real-world applications.  
- **Open-Source & Community:** Contributor to open-source AI tools; passionate about clean, reusable code.  
- **ML Competitions:** Proven record in structured prediction, fraud detection, and keyword spotting challenges.
